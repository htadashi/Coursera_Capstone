## üç£ A preliminary analysis of Foursquare ratings of sushi restaurants at New York City

Report, presentation and Jupyter notebook of the Capstone Project "A preliminary analysis of Foursquare ratings of sushi restaurants at New York City". This is the final project of the course "Applied Data Science Capstone", part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

In this project, it will be analyzed if (and how) some features obtained by the [Foursquare site](https://foursquare.com/) can be used to predict the Foursquare rating of sushi restaurants in New York City. As a possible future application, this work could help sushi restaurants owners (or prospective owners) in business decisions (such as credit card adoption) to help their restaurant gain a high score rating in Foursquare and, consequently, increase the publicity of their business.
